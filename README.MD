## Assumptions: 
1) Unity 6
2) A working VR project (probably based on the Unity VR Template)

## Note Well - import using the unity package!
The interesting_parts_of_the_source folder is just included for pedagogical purposes.

## Steps To Use
Import the ```vr_beer_props package``` from the ```unity_packages``` folder (this repo) into a Unity 6 VR project.

The two prefabs you are interested in are:

```prefabs/VR_Glass.prefab```

and

```dependencies/Beer Prop/Prefabs/keg.prefab```
